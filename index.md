    I am a full time working for one of the general firm, The purpose was to create some sort of a Knowledge base/ Cheat Sheets to contain various information about Ops, Security, Operating systems and more for my day to day use, since then the blog has changed and i guess it will continue to in the future.

    Hope you’ll find this place useful….

    Enjoy your staying.
